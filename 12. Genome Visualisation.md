# Genome Visualisation with Circos
This module generates a comprehensive circular visualization of the genome’s structural and sequence features using Circos. We focus on the 20 longest scaffolds to provide an informative overview of key genomic attributes, including coverage, GC content, repeat density, and heterozygosity.

## What you need
Input data
- **Reference genome** (.fna) with index file (.fai)
- **BAM file** of mapped reads (for coverage calculation)
- **VCF file** for heterozygosity
- **Repeat annotation file** (repeats.bed). Generated during the pipeline, but instructios also below
  
### Installations
You will need to download the [**circos.conf**](https://github.com/AureKylmanen/Swarmgenomics/blob/main/Scripts/circos.conf) file for plotting and download the required software.

Circos software: 
```
# Change to the directory where you want to install Circos
# E.g. /vol/storage/software
cd /vol/storage/software

# Get the latest circos download from https://circos.ca/software/download/
wget --no-check-certificate https://circos.ca/distribution/circos-0.69-9.tgz
tar -xvzf circos-0.69-9.tgz
```

You will also need Bedtools and Bcftools, which you should have from before (otherwise check [00.Installations](https://github.com/AureKylmanen/Swarmgenomics/blob/main/0.%20Installations.md) for instructions) and mosdepth.
```
conda install bioconda::mosdepth
```
## Preparing data for plotting
In this section we will prepare the data files, which are used for plotting.
```
# Get top 20 longest scaffolds or a number of your choosing
sort -k2,2nr -k1,1 reference.fna.fai | head -n 20 > top20_scaffolds.fai

# Generate karyotype file for Circos (adjust colors as needed)
# This names each scaffold as LG1, LG2 etc.
# Change "e4daed" to any colour of your choosing
awk '{print "chr -", $1, "LG" NR, 0, $2, "e4daed"}' top20_scaffolds.fai > karyotype.txt

# If you want to keep scaffold names use:
# awk '{print "chr -", $1, $1, 0, $2, "e4daed"}' top20_scaffolds.fai > karyotype.txt

# Generate 100kb bins and sort them
bedtools makewindows -g top20_scaffolds.fai -w 100000 | sort -k1,1 -k2,2n > bins.bed

# Get coverage from the bam file eg.:
mosdepth --by 100000 -t 4 sample bwa.sorted.bam
zcat sample.regions.bed.gz > coverage.txt

# Get GC content from the reference genome
bedtools nuc -fi reference.fna -bed bins.bed | awk 'NR>1 {print $1, $2, $3, $5}' > gc_content.txt

# Get the repeat content from the repeats.bed file which was generated earlier
bedtools intersect -a bins.bed -b repeats.bed -c | awk '{bin_size = $3 - $2; density = $4 / bin_size; printf "%s\t%d\t%d\t%.6f\n", $1, $2, $3, density}' > repeat_density.txt

# If repeats.bed not generated before use
# perl -lne 'if(/^(>.*)/){ $head=$1 } else { $fa{$head} .= $_ } END{ foreach $s (sort(keys(%fa))){ print "$s\n$fa{$s}\n" }}' reference.fna | perl -lne 'if(/^>(\S+)/){ $n=$1} else { while(/([a-z]+)/g){ printf("%s\t%d\t%d\n",$n,pos($_)-length($1),pos($_)) } }'  > repeats.bed

# Get heterozygosity from the vcf file
bcftools view -g het -Ov output.vcf.gz > heterozygous.vcf
bedtools intersect -a bins.bed -b heterozygous.vcf -c > heterozygosity_counts.txt
awk '{bin_size = $3 - $2; density = $4 / bin_size; printf "%s\t%d\t%d\t%.6f\n", $1, $2, $3, density}' heterozygosity_counts.txt > heterozygosity_density.txt
```
Download circos.conf file and edit the paths to the software if installed in a different location than /vol/storage/software. You may also change the colours of the different data tracks, to view options check https://circos.ca/documentation/tutorials/configuration/colors/lesson 

The circos.conf file has pre-set min and max values for the plots, but you can change them according to you data as guided below. To do this, first extract the actual values from your processed files. **For coverage**, it’s often best not to use the absolute maximum, as extreme outliers can skew the scale and make the rest of the data appear flat. Instead, choose a reasonable max value, such as 50 or 60, which corresponds to typical genome-wide average coverage. 
```
# Coverage min and max values
awk '{print $4}' coverage.txt | sort -n | awk 'NR==1 {min=$1} {max=$1} END {print "Min:", min, "Max:", max}'

# GC content min and max values 
awk '{print $4}' gc_content.txt | sort -n | awk 'NR==1 {min=$1} {max=$1} END {print "Min:", min, "Max:", max}'

# Heterozygosity min and max values
awk '{print $4}' heterozygosity_density.txt | sort -n | awk 'NR==1 {min=$1} {max=$1} END {print "Min:", min, "Max:", max}'

# Repeat min and max values
awk '{print $4}' repeat_density.txt | sort -n | awk 'NR==1 {min=$1} {max=$1} END {print "Min:", min, "Max:", max}'
```
## Running circos.conf
After you have edited the circos.conf file you can run circos
```
# Edit the path to the software accrodingly
/vol/storage/software/circos-0.69-9/bin/circos -conf circos.conf
```
To add a legend to the circos plot, dowload the [legend](https://github.com/AureKylmanen/Swarmgenomics/blob/main/Scripts/legend.png) and [overlay.py](https://github.com/AureKylmanen/Swarmgenomics/blob/main/Scripts/overlay.py) script
```
# Run overlay.py script
python overlay.py
```
## Output
The final output is a PNG of the Circos plot. It provides a circular visualization of the genome’s top 20 longest scaffolds, displaying multiple genomic features as concentric tracks. It includes GC content (purple line) showing the proportion of G/C bases per 100 kb bin, coverage (red histogram) representing sequencing depth with a configurable max value for better visualization, heterozygosity density (green heatmap) indicating genetic variation levels, and repeat density (blue heatmap) highlighting repetitive elements. These tracks help summarize complex genomic data in an intuitive and visually appealing way.
