# Genome features
Understanding alignment quality and genome representation across chromosomes is essential in evaluating sequencing results. This analysis uses samtools idxstats output to visualize:
- Chromosome length  
- Unmapped reads per megabase  
- Estimated coverage  

These summaries help identify uneven sequencing, poorly assembled scaffolds, or mapping issues that may impact downstream analyses like variant calling or population genomics.
## What you need
The only input needed is **a BAM file**, either one you already have or one generated using the SwarmGenomics pipeline. 
### Installations
You only need samtools and R installed with the following packages:

```r
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "gridExtra", "RColorBrewer", "patchwork"))
```

## Running idxstats

```
# Perform analysis
samtools idxstats bwa.sorted.bam > idxstats_output.txt
```

```
# Estimate typical read length from the bam file
# Take note of the length
samtools view bwa.sorted.bam | head -n 1000 | \
awk '{if($10 != "*") print length($10)}' | \
sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n1 | awk '{print $2}'
```

```
# Convert idxstats output into csv format for easier plotting 
awk 'BEGIN {OFS=","; print "chrom,length,mapped,unmapped"} {print $1,$2,$3,$4}' \
idxstats_output.txt > idxstats_clean.csv
```
Download the script [**idxstats.R**](https://github.com/AureKylmanen/Swarmgenomics/blob/main/Scripts/idxstats.R) for plotting the results. The script plots 20 longest scaffolds. 

If you wish to change the number of plotted scaffolds, edit or remove this line within the script:
```
slice(1:20) %>%
```
To plot, use the read lenght obtained earlier.
```
# Change the read length according to your estimate
Rscript idxstats_plot.R idxstats_clean.csv <READ_LENGTH>

# For example
Rscript idxstats.R idxstats_clean.csv 150
```
## Output
The script outputs a single PNG image showing the top 20 longest scaffolds with their lengths, unmapped reads per megabase, and estimated coverage, helping visualize mapping quality and assembly structure.
