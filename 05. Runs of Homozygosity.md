# Runs of Homozygosity
Runs of Homozygosity (ROH) are continuous stretches of homozygous genotypes within an individual's genome, indicating that the segments are inherited from common ancestors. ROH can provide insights into the genetic history of populations, including levels of inbreeding, past population bottlenecks, and patterns of natural selection.

### Installations
Bcftools

Download all_roh_bar_plots.R for plotting

Download R packages
```
# Install R
conda install r-essentials r-base

# Open R
R

# Install packages
# Choose CRAN mirror, e.g. 39
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "gridExtra", "data.table"))
```

### Running RoH analysis
```
# Change directory to vcf
cd vcf

# Get RoHs with bcftools
bcftools merge --force-samples -O z -o merged.vcf.gz *.vcf.gz
bcftools roh -G30 --AF-dflt 0.4 merged.vcf.gz > roh_results.txt

# Get only the RGs from the output file
grep -E "^# RG" roh_results.txt > RG.txt
grep -E "^RG" roh_results.txt >> RG.txt
awk '/^# RG/ {print; seen=1} seen && /^RG/' roh_results.txt > RG.txt

```
### Plotting RoH results
```
# Plot RoHs
Rscript all_roh_bar_plots.R
```
### RoH results

The bar plot provides an overview of the **number** and **total length** of Runs of Homozygosity (ROH) in the following size categories:

- **<0.1 Mbp:** Represents short ROH, typically reflecting ancient homozygosity.  
- **0.1 – 1 Mbp:** ROH in this range often result from distant shared ancestry within a population.  
- **1 – 2 Mbp:** These ROH suggest closer relatedness, typically found in populations with some degree of inbreeding.  
- **>3 Mbp:** Long ROH indicate recent inbreeding, often due to mating between closely related individuals.
