# Repeat Analysis
Repetitive regions were long believed to be just "junk DNA" but recent genomic projects, such as the Human Genome Project, revealed that these repeat elements play crucial roles in genome organization, function, and evolution.
Because of this, repeat analysis is an important step in genome annotation and involves identifying and characterizing repetitive elements within a genome. Two widely used tools for this purpose are RepeatModeler and RepeatMasker.

## What you need
You only need **a reference genome** to complete the repeat analysis. 

### Installations
RepeatModeler and RepeatMasker have many dependencies, so make sure you have everything below installed and configured.

## Running repeat analysis

The easisest way do the repeat analysis is by running the script **RepeatAnnotator.bash**, which you will first need to edit to give paths to the reference genome, working directory, RepeatModeler2 and RepeatMasker. 

The beginning of the script should then look something like this:
```
REFERENCE="/vol/storage/swarmGenomics/giant_panda/acreference.fna.gz"
wDIR="/vol/storage/swarmGenomics/giant_panda"
REPEATMODELER2="/vol/storage/software/RepeatModeler-2.0.4"
REPEATMASKER="/vol/storage/software/RepeatMasker"
```
Depending on how many threads you have available you might need to change the thread numbers, which are currently set as 13.

Before running the script make sure your reference genome is in zipped format, if not, you can compress it with gzip:
```
gzip acreference.fna
```
Once you have added the paths to the RepeatAnnotator.bash and compressed the reference genome, you can run the script. The script takes usually around 24-48h to run, but it depends on the size and thread number.
```
# Use nohup and & to allow the script to run even when you close the terminal
nohup ./RepeatAnnotator.bash &
```
If your script fails, read the nohup.out file, which will give you information on which step has failed. Usually the problems are typos in the paths, or issues with the installations.

## Results
The final results are in an html file (e.g. acreference.repeat_landscape.html) which you will need to copy to your computer for viewing. The end result is a repeat landscape, with Kimura substitution level on the x-axis and percentage of repeat families on the y-axis. Lower Kimura values indicate fewer mutations and thus more recent insertions, while higher values indicate more mutations, suggesting older insertions. The shape and number of peaks can indicate the activity patterns of different repeat families over time. You may look up more information on the different repeat families and how to analyse these results.
