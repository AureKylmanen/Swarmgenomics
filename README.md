# Swarmgenomics


Advances in sequencing technologies have led to a boom in genomic projects, making genomic data readily available. This Citizen Science Project aims to demonstrate how a single genome can be analysed with simple computational methods to provide valuable information about the genetic diversity of the population and its evolutionary history.
