# SwarmGenomics


Advances in sequencing technologies have led to a boom in genomic projects, making genomic data readily available. This Citizen Science Project aims to demonstrate how a single genome can be analysed with simple computational methods to provide valuable information about the genetic diversity of the population and its evolutionary history.

SwarmGenomics compromises of a step-by-step process of whole-genome assembly, followed by modules which guide the user through different genomic analyses. At present, the modules are heterozygosity analysis, runs of homozygosity detection, PSMC analysis, unmapped reads analysis, repeat analysis, mitochondrial genome assembly, and nuclear mitochondrial DNA (NUMT) analysis. The modules include key population genetic and evolutionary analyses, from which the user can choose from. The pipeline has been created especially for researcher with limited bioinformatics experience and students, and can be used as a teaching material or as self-learning
